    "#### You may submit the homework up to 24 hours late (with the same grace period) for a penalty of 10%. \n",

    "All homeworks will be scored with a maximum of 100 points; point values are given\n",

    "will be counted equally toward the total for that problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: I strongly recommend you work in **Google Colab** (the free version) to complete homeworks in this class; in addition to (probably) being faster than your laptop, all the necessary libraries will already be available to you, and you don't have to hassle with <code>conda</code>, <code>pip</code>, etc. and resolving problems when the install doesn't work. But it is up to you!   You should go through the necessary tutorials listed on the web site concerning Colab and storing files on a Google Drive. And of course, Dr. Google is always ready to help you resolve your problems. \n",

    "#### Submission Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "You must complete the homework by editing <b>this notebook</b> and submitting the following two files in Gradescope by the due date and time:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - A file <code>HW03.ipynb</code> (be sure to select <code>Kernel -> Restart and Run All</code> before you submit, to make sure everything works); and\n",
    "  - A file <code>HW03.pdf</code> created from the previous.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  For best results obtaining a clean PDF file on the Mac, select <code>File -> Print Review</code> from the Jupyter window, then choose <code>File-> Print</code> in your browser and then <code>Save as PDF</code>.  Something  similar should be possible on a Windows machine -- just make sure it is readable and no cell contents have been cut off. Make it easy to grade!\n",
    "  \n",
    "The date and time of your submission is the last file you submitted, so if your IPYNB file is submitted on time, but your PDF is late, then your submission is late. "
